<p>When a rogue angel known as “Insanity” escapes and starts a polygamist cult in Central Utah, all Hell breaks loose. Friends murder friends, husbands abandon wives, heads leave their bodies, and a frenzied fat man beats his revered prophet with a broom – and this is just the beginning.</p>

If God’s omnipotence and omnibenevolence can be reconciled with the existence of evil, it kinds makes you wonder what’s going on in God’s head. Even if it doesn’t make sense, it makes a great premise for a fantasy-adventure novel!!</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Valley-Fire-Brett-Cottrell/dp/0615567479">The Valley of Fire</a> the different aspects of the mind of God (God’s wrath, God’s genius, etc.) travel through space and time to recapture God’s Insanity — who escaped while helping Jesus and Contradiction help people understand God’s mysteries. Why can’t the other components of God’s mind recapture His insanity? Well — since it’s narrated by God’s Contradiction — the rules of this fictional universe are excused from having to be consistent or coherent. And it works. Our heroes battle angels of fire, have a dangerous run-in with the seal holding back the horsemen of the Apocalypse, and even enlist the aid of Porter Rockwell before discovering that Insanity was running his own polygamist sect. It’s easily a more interesting solution than simply sending God to a shrink and prescribing Him some lithium.</i> <a href="https://mainstreetplaza.com/2012/04/06/the-contradiction-of-god-brett-cottrells-the-valley-of-fire/"><b>Read more</b></a></p>
