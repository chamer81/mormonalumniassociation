<p>Micah doesn't like how his Mormon faith pigeonholes his sexuality: that being "gay" is like being "hooked on a drug."  When he was little, he would lie in bed at night and imagine God giving out awards to all those gay spirits who saw past the ignorance of the Church, living their lives on Earth freely.

Once I picked it up, it was hard to put down until I had finished, and I am certain it will haunt me for long after I turned the last page. The characters are vivid and believable, and the story powerful and almost perfectly told. And like all truly great stories, it leaves you at the end unsettled, with a few really good questions and no answers but those you must work to supply yourself.</i> <a href="http://youngstranger.blogspot.ch/2010/10/ockhams-razor-review.html"><b>Read more</b></a></p>
<p><i>If the popular stereotypes are true, I think a lot of straight men would find this novel difficult — not because of the explicit man-on-man sex action, but because of the explicit (and frequent) man-on-man “let’s talk about our relationship” action. Sexist stereotypes aside, if you’re one of those people who thinks a good story ought to include some car-chases and explosions, then you probably won’t find this novel interesting. On the other hand, if you think that working to understand yourself and your relationships can be a story, then you’ll likely enjoy this book, as I did.</p>
<p><a href=http://www.amwilliams.com/ockhamsrazor.html">Ockham’s Razor</a> is the tale of a relationship between two gay males within Mormon culture. More precisely, it tells a story of a gay teenage boy trying to figure out how to reconcile his homosexuality with his Mormon faith — and what happens when he meets up with an older gay male in Mormon culture who has already made his choices.</i> <a href="http://mainstreetplaza.com/2009/10/10/lets-talk-about-our-relationship-ockhams-razor-by-alan-michael-williams/"><b>Read more</b></a></p>
