Dumm. The pen name for author Scott Stevens—a play on the name Paul H. Dunn—sets the tone for this 103-page book of speculative fiction of Mormon life. A  popular speaker during the 70s and 80s, Dunn, an LDS general authority, told many faith-promoting stories about his days playing baseball and his service in World War II. Many were inspired by his stories, and he was in much demand as a speaker. In fact, when I served an LDS mission in New England during the early 80s, it was “Elder Dunn” in whom I confided by letter about my deep angst over how my father, a BYU religion professor, had been publicly savaged by one of Dunn’s own colleagues: Apostle Bruce R. McConkie. The incident was over a book my father had written about developing a personal relationship to Jesus Christ. <a href="https://mainstreetplaza.com/2024/09/18/wandering-the-afterlife-never-knowing-the-plot-review-of-tales-of-unworthiness-by-paul-h-dumm/"><b>Read more</b></a></p>
