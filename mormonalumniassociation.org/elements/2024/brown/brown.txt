Ben and his little sister Miley are down on their luck. With mounting medical bills and no income to pay them, Ben will do anything to keep his sister safe and well. When he finds a Poker Night invitation right outside a church, Ben knows his luck must be improving. Will poker night be the beginning of a new life for Ben and Miley, or will it turn Ben into a wrecking ball that destroys the lives of his new poker friends?

When Father William Atley walks away from that poker game with all of Ben's money, he can't get the new player out of his mind. But love is off limits for Father William, who is running from his own wrecking ball past.
