In Beneath the Stage, 11 year-old Timothy prepares to become a deacon. He soon finds that the covenant path is fraught with obstacles, and his progression falters.

In Sector 69-G, Ruben is ecstatic to be resurrected after a long sojourn in spirit prison, only to learn that his mediocre performance in mortality has left him unfit for the Celestial Kingdom.
