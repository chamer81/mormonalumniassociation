From Mark Davis:

My daughter Rebecca Stevenson is a HS literature teacher, polyglot, anthropologist, voracious reader, and prolific writer of essays, stories, and fanfic.  She has a collection of essays accepted by BCC Press, but I don't know how far along that project is.  You can see some of the essays in their raw form at her blog: https://malihini-view.blogspot.com/

She has a fantasy series manuscript written (which I think is on the back burner now), and just completed a novel which is Mormon take on the Japanese manga series Cherry Magic.  She's looking for a publisher/agent for it now.  I also gave her your contact information, but if you'd like to reach out, her email is beccamalihini@gmail.com



Here's a link to a recent note from Becca's blog that references her gay missionary novel obliquely, and also touches on her take on Mormonism
